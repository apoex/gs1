## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Creating a Release

#### Update the Changelog

1. Rename the [Unreleased] section to match the version that is being released
1. Add the current date in the section from previous step. See existing entries
1. Add a new section for the `Unreleased` section at the top
1. Add a new reference link for the new section at the bottom of the changelog
1. Update the `Unreleased` reference link at the bottom of the changelog

#### Publish New Version of Gem

To publish a new version of this gem, follow the steps below:

1. Update the version in the [version.rb](lib/gs1/version.rb) file
1. Run `bundle` to update Gemfile.lock
1. Commit and push the changes

1. Run `rake release:initiate`. This initiates a new release by creating a Git
    tag with the version specified in [version.rb](lib/gs1/version.rb). It will
    then push the Git tag. This will trigger a job in the CI pipeline, which
    will build the gem and publish it to https://rubygems.org. It will also
    create a GitHub Release, in draft mode

1. Check the GitHub Release and then publish it
